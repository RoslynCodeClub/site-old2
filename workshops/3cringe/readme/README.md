# Cringe Off.


### Step 1: Setting up the files
Create a folder for this project. I'll be calling my folder cringe_off.

To start, create two files in your folder: ```index.html``` ```styles.css```

Next, open the ```index.html``` file. First, we will declare a doctype. Weâ€™re using html as our coding language, so we will type ```<!DOCTYPE HTML>```. 

Now, we will create the shell of the webpage. Start with the ```<html>``` tag. Inside the html tag, put a ```<head>``` tag and a ```<body>``` tag. Your file should look like this: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
	<head></head>
	<body></body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Setting up the header

The ```<head>``` tag contains head elements. Pretty self-explanatory, right?

Head elements are generally things such as ```<title>``` or ```<link>```. 
</br> The ```<title>``` tag is required on all HTML webpages, and defines the title of the webpage. It's the name you see on a new tab, such as "Roslyn Code" on roslyncode.tech.
</br> The ```<link>``` tag is generally used to link your CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML document.

Let's use the ```<title>``` and ```<link>``` tags now.

I'll be making my title "Cringey Website."

As you can see below, there's more we have to add to the ```<link>``` tag. Sadly, it's not just simply ```<link></link>```.
</br> Generally, when linking a CSS file, we state the relationship of the CSS file first as a stylesheet. This is represented by ```rel="stylesheet"```.
</br> Next, to show that the file we're linking is a CSS file, we state that the ```type="text/css"```.
</br> Finally, to actually link the CSS file, we type ```href="styles.css"```.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Cringey Website.</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
	</head>
	<body></body>
</html>
```

Congrats, now you know how to make a title for your webpage and link a stylesheet! 
</br> Note: Your code will work without ```rel="stylesheet"``` and ```type="text/css"```, but it's generally recommended to keep it.

### Step 3: Adding fonts

Everyone knows we can't have a cringey website without some Comic Sans!
</br> But before we can start customizing fonts, we need some words on our page. Let's write a funny joke inside our ```<body>``` tag.

To add some words on the page, I'll be using an ```<h1>``` tag, but you could just as easily use a ```<p>``` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Cringey Website.</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>My Life</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
Now that we have our funny joke on our page, let's go edit our ```styles.css``` file.

Double click your ```styles.css``` file to get started. 
</br>To change the font of our words, we'll have to use ```font-family: "Comic Sans MS";```
</br>In my case, I want to change the font of the words inside my ```<h1>``` tag.

```css
h1 {
	font-family: "Comic Sans MS";
}
```
Luckily for us, Comic Sans is a CSS Web Safe Font, meaning that we didn't have to do anything too fancy to add it.

*But... what if I want a fancier font?*
</br> Don't you worry, sir! Father Google has come to our rescue. If you go to <a href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank">fonts.google.com</a>, they have nearly every font you could possibly want.

Scroll down and find a font you like. Once you've found one, or a few, click the red circle with a plus sign. 
</br> Now, click the black bar on the bottom of the site that says "1 Family Selected."
</br> How lucky! It tells us exactly what to copy and paste into our HTML and CSS.

I personally chose the font Chewy.
</br>My updated code now looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Cringe Off!</title>
        <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chewy" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My Life</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

```css
h1 {
    font-family: "Chewy";
}
```
Now I know what you're thinking. "Yeah, fonts are fun and all, but this isn't nearly cringey enough for my liking." 

And you're right. 
### Step 4: Adding GIFs
Ahh, finally. 
There are a few ways we could add gifs to our page. I'll go over two ways.

##### First Way:

Go to <a href="https://giphy.com" target="_blank">giphy.com</a>.
</br> Find the gif you'd like, and then click on it. You should see a button that says "Embed."
</br> Click the embed button, and just copy and paste the code into your HTML file.

It's as simple as that!

If you choose to do it this way, your code should look similar to the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Cringe Off!</title>
        <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chewy" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7aD4nEllNzJUg7Go" width="480" height="384" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/stickers/3o7aD4nEllNzJUg7Go">via GIPHY</a></p>
    </body>
</html>
```
##### Second Way:

Find any gif you'd like. Whether it's on tumblr, google image search, or giphy, it doesn't matter.

For this way, all you need is the link to the image. 
</br>(If you choose to do this with giphy again, click "copy link" this time and copy the GIF link.)

To use our image, we'll use the ```<img>``` tag. 
</br> ```<img src="insert link here"></img>```

If you choose this way, your code should look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Cringe Off!</title>
        <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chewy" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J9s9aNczfTBeOgo/giphy.gif"></img>
    </body>
</html>
```
I personally prefer this way. 

##### Bonus: Having a gif as a background image
Regular old gifs not enough cringe for you? I've got you covered.

In your CSS file, do the following:

```css
html {
    background-image: url("insert link here");
}
```
My CSS file currently looks like this:

```css
html {
    background-image: url("https://media.giphy.com/media/7Rx1bEIzPXLOM/giphy.gif");
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
h1 {
    font-family: "Chewy";
}
```
As you can probably tell, background-size sets the size of your background image. I've set mine to cover the size of the window.
</br> Background-repeat sets how/if your background image will repeat at all. I've chosen no-repeat, but maybe you enjoy that early 2000s small-image repeating background look.

### Step 5: Adding audio
Want cringey music? Your wish is my command.

Download any mp3 file you'd like from the internet. 
Here are some links:

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-u_4lVt9AeCQm9oY3pfR2hWWDQ/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-u_4lVt9AeCQm9oY3pfR2hWWDQ/view?usp=sharing</a>

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-u_4lVt9AeCaWJBcW1MVlNEZkE/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-u_4lVt9AeCaWJBcW1MVlNEZkE/view?usp=sharing</a>

</br> Upload it to Cloud9 by clicking "File" --> "Upload Local Files"
</br> Make sure the file is in the folder with your ```index.html``` and ```styles.css``` files.

To set up our audio, we can use the ```<audio>``` tag.

```html
<audio>
    <source src="insert file name here" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```

Even though we've added our audio- how do we get it to play?
</br> By using autoplay.
</br> Want it to loop? We can do that too.

```html
<audio loop autoplay>
    <source src="insert file name here" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```
Your entire index.html file should look similar to the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Cringe Off!</title>
        <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chewy" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J9s9aNczfTBeOgo/giphy.gif"></img>
        <audio loop autoplay>
            <source src="Heyayayay.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
    </body>
</html>
```

Congrats! You've now learned how to add fonts, gifs, and audio to your webpage.

<b>Go out there, create a cringey website, and make us proud.</b>
